## Welcome to Lara Daneshgaran's Homepage

I am a senior undergraduate student at [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) studying ~~electrical~~ `computer engineering`.

Our school motto: 

> **Fiat lux** or _Let there be light_

I spent a lot of time at Geisel while studying at UCSD.
